                  THE RACF CRACKER PROGRAM
               ** 2007 version, with source program **

The RACF CRACKER PROGRAM achieves a dictionary attack against all
userids of the RACF database.


The JCL you should adapt and submit is : CRACKER

The dictionary itself is in : CRACDICT
  (It contains about 90000 English, French and Spanish words.
   You may modify it)

Limitations :

- in this version, you must have a "modern" CPU with the CPACF
  feature installed.
  CPACF is "CP Assist for Cryptographic Function" (clear-key encryption).

- an APF-authorized library is be required if passwords are to be
  obtained from the RACF database (rather than supplied in their
  encrypted form).

- CRACKER only tests for DES passwords. Hashed passwords are not
  decrypted.

- this program must be used only by authorized persons having
  READ access to the RACF database.
  The output in the spool should be carefully protected so that
  in-clear passwords decrypted by the program be not readable.
